<h1>Rhetorical Analysis Terms</h1>

<h2>Alliteration</h2>
<ul>

</ul>

<h2>Allusion</h2>
<ul>
<li>A direct or indirect reference to something which is presumably commonly known, such as an event, book, myth, place, or work of art. Allusions can be historical (like referring to Hitler), literary (like referring to Kurtz in Heart of Darkness), religious (like referring to Noah and the flood), or mythical (like referring to Atlas). There are, of course, many more possibilities, and a work may simultaneously use multiple layers of allusion. Consider why a writer chooses any particular allusion as related to purpose. </li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>Antistrophe</h2>

</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Antithesis</h2>

<h2>Purpose (also called Rhetorical Purpose)</h2>

</ul>

<h2>Rhetorical Question</h2>
<ul>

</ul>

<h2>Rhetorical Situation</h2>
<ul>
<li>the context, or the culmination of events or people that create exigence (a necessity to speak out). Because rhetoric is framed around the way it will be received, the rhetorical situation influences the wording with which orators present arguments, and the arguments that are made in the first place. </li>

<li>For example, MLK’s rhetorical situation in his Letter from a Birmingham Jail was the continual discrimination in Alabama and the bystanding clergymen who are complicit in it. Their questioning of his timing and direct action being taken provided the exigence for MLK to write his letter, which he writes in response to the inaction and criticism of his peers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rhetorical Structure</h2>
<ul>
<li>This phrase refers to how a passage is constructed. If asked to consider rhetorical structure, look at the passage’s organization and how the writer combines images, details, or arguments to serve his or her purpose.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sentence Structure</h2>
<ul>
<li>When an essay question asks you to analyze sentence structure, look at the type of sentences the author uses. Remember that the basic sentence structures are simple, compound, and complex, and variations are created with sentence combining. Also consider variation or lack of it in sentence length, any unusual devices in sentence construction, such as repetition or inverted word order, and any unusual word or phrase placement. As with all devices, be prepared to discuss the effect of the sentence structure. For example, a series of short, simple sentences or phrases can produce a feeling of speed and choppiness, which may suit the author’s purpose.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Simile</h2>
<ul>
<li>an explicit comparison between two things using 'like' or 'as'.</li>
<ul class= "circle">
	<li>*My love is as a fever . . . Shakespeare, Sonnet CXLVII</li>
</ul>
</ul>

	<li>*We must all hang together or assuredly we will all hang separately. Benjamin Franklin</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Tautology</h2>
<ul>
<li>repetition of an idea in a different word, phrase, or sentence for emphasis.</li>
<ul class= "circle">
	<li>*With malice toward none, with charity for all. Lincoln, Second Inaugural Address</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Tone</h2>
<ul>
<li>the attitude of the writer toward a subject or audience. Some words that can describe tone are playful, somber, didactic, sarcastic, etc. </li>
</ul>
